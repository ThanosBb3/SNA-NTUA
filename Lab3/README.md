# Link Prediction
Using the dataset <a href="http://konect.cc/networks/dbpedia-similar/"> Similarities (DBpedia)</a>, we create a graph and keep a list of the missing edges, the ones we removed are the ones that will exist in the future, and the ones that did not already exist, won't exist in the future too. Then, we study the Jaccard Coefficient and, later, on train and test sets, we use a Random Forest Classifier with Jaccard Coefficient, Preferential Attachment and Resource Allocation of missing edges, to make some predictions and evaluate them. In the end, we use Node2Vec to extract features and, again, use Random Forest Classifier using these features.
