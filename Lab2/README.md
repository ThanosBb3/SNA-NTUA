# Community Detection in Real and Synthetic Network Topologies
Analyzing real and synthetic network by metrics of the previous lab exercise, interpreting community detection as a partition problem and using the Newman-Girvan, Spectral Clustering and Modularity Maximization methods to form communities in the above graphs, and evaluating the results, considering modularity and performance.
